Using php composer

Note for Apple M2 processor
===
some driver might check for the processor for example MS SQL , currently M2 is not supported (err: Unsupported processor architecture.). To mitigate this issue, you can run docker service with emulate platform. for example
```
  php8.2.fpm.mssql:
        build: php-stack-8.2-fpm-mssql
        container_name: "php8.2.fpm.mssql"
        platform: linux/amd64
```
